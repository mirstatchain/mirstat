//! A durable record of what things were worth.
//!
//! The chain stores only coin ids — no amounts — so a wallet can price a
//! transaction solely from coins it still holds. That makes naive history
//! arithmetic decay: spend the change from a send and the send's recorded
//! value shrinks; spend a received coin and the receipt shrinks too. The
//! displayed past changes because the present changed, which is worse than
//! showing nothing.
//!
//! This ledger fixes that by writing values down at the moment they are known
//! and never forgetting them:
//!
//! * **Coin values** are captured opportunistically from whatever the wallet
//!   currently holds. A coin observed even once keeps its value here after it
//!   is spent, which is exactly when the wallet itself forgets.
//! * **Sends** are recorded on completion, when walletd knows the amount and
//!   the destination as typed.
//!
//! Nothing here is truly lost to the chain. A `Reveal` publishes `value` on
//! every input and output (consensus has to check conservation), and each
//! output carries its `address` — which IS the address, the same 32 bytes the
//! 72-character string encodes. So amounts and destinations alike can be
//! rebuilt by rescanning the block store; see `repair_history`. This ledger
//! exists to avoid that rescan, not because the data is unrecoverable.
