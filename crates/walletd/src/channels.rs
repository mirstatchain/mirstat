//! Q-Bolt channel bookkeeping for walletd: durable records, inbound-open
//! staging, replay guarding, and the chat-frame parse helper. All protocol
//! *logic* (validation, signing, close/refund driving) lives in service.rs
//! where the wallet and node handles are; this module is the state it acts on.
//!
//! Persistence: a JSON sidecar next to wallet.dat (`<wallet>.channels.json`).
//! It holds channel metadata and counterparty signatures — nothing that
//! spends YOUR coins (your signing keys stay inside the encrypted wallet) —
//! but balances are visible to anyone who reads the file. Encrypting the
//! sidecar under the wallet password is a tracked follow-up.
