//! Live cross-chain swaps: the state that must survive a restart, and the
//! rules for advancing it.
//!
//! A swap is the one place in this wallet where losing track of state loses
//! money. Between the two legs there is always a window in which one side has
//! committed and the other has not, and the only thing standing between that
//! window and a loss is a wallet that keeps watching. So every transition is
//! written to disk before the action that causes it, and the watcher is
//! written to be resumable from any point.
//!
//! Two roles, mirror images of each other:
//!
//! * **Taker** — takes a published order. Locks ETH against the order's hash,
//!   waits for the maker to claim it (which publishes the preimage), then
//!   sweeps the MDS. If the maker never claims, refunds the ETH.
//! * **Maker** — published the order and holds the secret. Watches for an
//!   incoming lock against one of its hashes, verifies it, then claims the ETH
//!   — which is what releases the preimage the taker needs.
//!
//! The maker is always the one who reveals, and always on Base. That is why
//! the Base escrow must expire first: after the reveal the taker still has to
//! act on mirstat.
