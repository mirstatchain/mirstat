//! mirstat-walletd — the headless wallet service behind the mirstat desktop app.
//!
//! Design (see docs/mirstat-gui-wallet-plan.md §3–§4):
//! - One actor owns the open `mirstat::wallet::Wallet` and is the ONLY code
//!   allowed to mutate it. All UI surfaces talk to it through [`WalletdHandle`].
//! - The full node runs in-process ([`node_host`]); walletd holds its
//!   `NodeHandle` and answers every chain question from local validated state.
//! - Sends are persisted state machines (commit → mined → reveal → confirmed),
//!   resumed on unlock from the wallet's own `PendingCommit` records.
//!
//! WOTS one-time-signature invariants enforced here, not in the UI:
//! - a coin whose key has signed (`wots_signed`) is never selected again;
//! - coins referenced by any live pending commit are never double-planned;
//! - MSS leaf indices are verified against chain + mempool and fast-forwarded
//!   (safety margin 20) before every signing session, mirroring the CLI.
