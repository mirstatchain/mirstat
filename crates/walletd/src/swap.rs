//! Cross-chain swap planning, and the checks that make one safe to start.
//!
//! Two rails, chosen deliberately rather than automatically:
//!
//! * **Submarine** — the MDS leg rides a Q-Bolt channel. Instant, because a
//!   channel payment is a signed state handed over the chat bus. The whole
//!   swap then costs roughly two Base blocks.
//! * **On-chain** — the MDS leg is an ordinary HTLC. Works with no channel at
//!   all, but pays for two commit→reveal cycles on a 60-second chain, which is
//!   where essentially all of the old latency came from.
//!
//! ## The two clocks
//!
//! This is the part that loses money if it is wrong. A Q-Bolt HTLC expires at
//! a mirstat **block height** (`OP_CHECKTIMEVERIFY`); the Base contract
//! expires at a **unix timestamp** (`block.timestamp + refundDelay`). They are
//! not the same units and there is no oracle between them — heights convert to
//! wall-clock only through the 60-second block target, which drifts.
//!
//! So every comparison here is done in seconds, using a *pessimistic* estimate
//! of the mirstat deadline, and the required margin is deliberately large.
//! When the numbers do not fit, the plan is refused rather than narrowed:
//! a swap that starts unsafe cannot be made safe afterwards.

//
// An order is advertised as power-of-two units, and *each unit is claimed by
// its own separate transaction*. That transaction pays its own fee, so a unit
// is only worth trading if it is comfortably larger than that fee. Units below
// that threshold are not merely uneconomic — they are unclaimable, and a taker
// who escrows ETH against one loses it outright: by the time the MDS leg is
// swept the maker has already claimed the ETH, which is how the preimage
// became public in the first place. There is no refund branch after that
// point, and there must not be.
//
// So the threshold is enforced in two independent places, and deliberately so:
// the maker refuses to *publish* such a unit, and the taker refuses to *take*
// one. The second check is the load-bearing one, because orders arrive from
// peers whose software we do not control.

/// Smallest unit that may be published or taken.
///
/// Must be a power of two. That is what makes the maker-side check a single
/// remainder test: if `amount % MIN_SWAP_UNIT == 0` then every bit set in
/// `amount` is at or above `MIN_SWAP_UNIT`, so no sub-threshold unit can be
/// produced by the decomposition.
///
/// 1024 leaves roughly 97% of the unit's value after the sweep fee. Chosen to
