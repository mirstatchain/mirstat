//! The cross-chain order book, assembled from two chains at once.
//!
//! Neither side requires trusting a counterparty or an indexer:
//!
//! * **Bids** (someone offering ETH for MDS) escrow their ETH inside
//!   `mirstatAtomicSwap` at creation. A `BidCreated` with no matching
//!   `BidClaimed`/`BidCancelled` is therefore *funded* liquidity, verifiable
//!   from contract logs alone.
//! * **Asks** (someone offering MDS for ETH) publish an MDXA announcement as
//!   zero-value burns in the very transaction that funds the HTLC, so an ask
//!   is verifiable by checking those coins are still unspent.
//!
//! This module is read-only. It never signs anything and never moves value,
//! which makes it safe to run against mainnet while the execution paths are
//! still being built.
